### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__:

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Excelling (3)** - Overall, you have an excellent readme, which I appreciate! Your
user stories are well through out, but I'd suggest following the format of

> As a blank, I want to blank, so I can blank.

It may seem silly, but it really helped me make my user stories more focused and
corresponding to a user's perspective.

* __Technical Requirements__:

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

** Performing (2) ** - Your app is very solid technically. You used all the
techniques we covered in class, and used them well! It'd be nice to see a few
more features, such as updating the number of matches up in the header.

* __Code Quality__:

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

** High Performing (2.75) ** - Your code quality is great! Good variable names,
function names, well commented, etc. The main things I'd like to see improved
are removing dead code, and focusing on shorter functions when possible. Overall
though, great job here.

* __Creativity/Interface__:

>Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

** Performing (2) ** - The minimalism is kinda nice, but it'd be great to show
off a bit more about what you can do with HTML / CSS.
