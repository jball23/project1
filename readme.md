How To Play:

Click a square to reveal it's color, and then click another square to reveal it's color.  If they match, the squares will stay revealed and you can move on to new squares that you haven't explored yet.  Try to remember where each color is so you can match them all in as few moves as possible!  

You can click the reset button at any time to start the game over and shuffle the colors.
